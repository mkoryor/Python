"""
[H] We are given a list of Jobs. Each job has a Start time, an End time, and a 
CPU load when it is running. Our goal is to find the maximum CPU load at any 
time if all the jobs are running on the same machine.

Example 1:

Jobs: [[1,4,3], [2,5,4], [7,9,6]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Since [1,4,3] and [2,5,4] overlap, their maximum CPU load (3+4=7) 
will be when both the jobs are running at the same time i.e., during the time interval (2,4).
