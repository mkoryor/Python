[M] Given an array of numbers sorted in an ascending order, find the ceiling of a given 
number ‘key’. The ceiling of the ‘key’ will be the smallest element in the given 
array greater than or equal to the ‘key’.

Write a function to return the index of the ceiling of the ‘key’. 
If there isn’t any ceiling return -1.

Example 1:

Input: [4, 6, 10], key = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest number greater than or equal to '6' is '6' having index '1'.
