[M] Given an array of numbers sorted in ascending order, find the floor of a given number 
‘key’. The floor of the ‘key’ will be the biggest element in the given array smaller 
than or equal to the ‘key’

Write a function to return the index of the floor of the ‘key’. 
If there isn’t a floor, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: [4, 6, 10], key = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The biggest number smaller than or equal to '6' is '6' having index '1'.
