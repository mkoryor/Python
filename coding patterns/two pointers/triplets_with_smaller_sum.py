[E] Given an array arr of unsorted numbers and a target sum, count all triplets in it 
such that arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] < target where i, j, and k are three different indices. 
Write a function to return the count of such triplets.
Input: [-1, 0, 2, 3], target=3 
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two triplets whose sum is less than the target: [-1, 0, 3], [-1, 0, 2]
