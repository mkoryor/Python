Given a string and a pattern, write a method to count the number of 
times the pattern appears in the string as a subsequence.

Example 1: Input: string: “baxmx”, pattern: “ax”
Output: 2
Explanation: {baxmx, baxmx}.

Example 2:

Input: string: “tomorrow”, pattern: “tor”
Output: 4
Explanation: Following are the four occurences: 
{tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow}.
