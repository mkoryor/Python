"""
Given a number sequence, find the increasing subsequence with the highest sum. 
Write a method that returns the highest sum.

Example 1:

Input: {4,1,2,6,10,1,12}
Output: 32
Explanation: The increaseing sequence is {4,6,10,12}. 
Please note the difference, as the LIS is {1,2,6,10,12} which has a sum of '31'.
Example 2:

Input: {-4,10,3,7,15}
Output: 25
Explanation: The increaseing sequences are {10, 15} and {3,7,15}.
