"""
Given two strings ‘s1’ and ‘s2’, find the length of the longest subsequence 
which is common in both the strings.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence 
by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "abdca"
       s2 = "cbda"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "bda".
Example 2:

Input: s1 = "passport"
       s2 = "ppsspt"
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "psspt".
