"""
Given strings s1 and s2, we need to transform s1 into s2 by deleting and 
inserting characters. Write a function to calculate the count of the minimum 
number of deletion and insertion operations.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "abc"
       s2 = "fbc"
Output: 1 deletion and 1 insertion.
Explanation: We need to delete {'a'} and insert {'f'} to s1 to 
transform it into s2.
Example 2:

Input: s1 = "abdca"
       s2 = "cbda"
Output: 2 deletions and 1 insertion.
Explanation: We need to delete {'a', 'c'} and insert {'c'} to s1 to transform it into s2.
