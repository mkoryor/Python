Given two strings ‘s1’ and ‘s2’, find the length of the longest substring which 
is common in both the strings.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "abdca"
       s2 = "cbda"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest common substring is "bd".
Example 2:

Input: s1 = "passport"
       s2 = "ppsspt"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common substring is "ssp".
