Given the weights and profits of 'N' items, we are asked to put these 
items in a knapsack which has a capacity 'C'. The goal is to get the 
maximum profit from the items in the knapsack. Each item can only be 
selected once, as we dont have multiple quantities of any item.

Lets take the example of Merry, who wants to carry some fruits in 
the knapsack to get maximum profit. Here are the weights and profits 
of the fruits:

Items: { Apple, Orange, Banana, Melon }
Weights: { 2, 3, 1, 4 }
Profits: { 4, 5, 3, 7 }
Knapsack capacity: 5

Lets try to put different combinations of fruits in the knapsack, such that their total weight is not more than 5:

Apple + Orange (total weight 5) => 9 profit
Apple + Banana (total weight 3) => 7 profit
Orange + Banana (total weight 4) => 8 profit
Banana + Melon (total weight 5) => 10 profit
