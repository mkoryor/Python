"""
[M] Given an array of characters where each character 
represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets and your 
goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only 
restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.

You can start with any tree, but once you have started you can’t 
skip a tree. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., 
you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.

Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
Output: 3
Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in 
the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
